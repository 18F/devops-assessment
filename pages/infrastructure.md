## Is the application infrastructure self-service?

Self-service infrastructure is key to productivity and autonomy of engineers
across all disciplines. 

- Reduces the overhead of infrastructure management and distributes the load
  of turning on new systems.
- Implies background automation which ensures that systems are deployed
  consistently and reliably.
- Enables teams and individual engineers to work in parallel.
- Leverages shared effort in the creation of baseline configurations and
  procedures.

## Is the infrastructure elastic?

Elastic infrastructure can turned on, scaled up, scaled down and turned off
quickly, automatically.

- Enables to low-cost creation of comprehensive environments for development
  and test.
- Capable of responding dynamically or as scheduled to meet application loads
  ensuring  a good user experience.
- Maximizes system utilization.

## Are any platform PaaS services in use?

A PaaS, which is really just very refined, well-oiled developer workflow is
a medium-effort very high reward option for reducing overhead.

- Enforces consistent application design.
- Enables near complete developer autonomy.
- Leverages shared effort in the creation of configurations.

## Which PaaS are in use?

There are numerous options, premise, cloud, open source and commercial.

**Comment:** _Use of a PaaS would imply a fairly well-prepared and
forward-thinking organization. An organization at this stage likely has
several other ducks in a row. Opportunities here might expanding its use by
suggesting ways to refactor applications to use the platform or swapping out
OSS / public solutions for a more costly premise system._

## What is the self-service infrastructure is in use?

There are numerous options, premise, cloud, infrastructure, platform and
focused versus suite service offerings.

**Comment:** _This is about identifying how a good practice, using
self-service infrastructure can be improved through the use of alternative /
open source solutions or lesser-known features of existing services._

## Which self-service services are available?

Fully self-service premise environments are rare outside of \*aaS providers.
Any amount of self-service is a benefit.

## How are these services consumed?

Multiple options are ideal. An API/CLI is essential for automation.

**Comment:** _This is about identifying low effort, high reward possibilities
like automation and CI/CD by wrapping the existing solutions or integrating
them with SaaS / OSS. Web interface is the bare minimum. API is an avenue for
complex, high value integrations. CLI is quick and simple with immediate
returns._

## Are new system requests a "one-stop-shop"?

If self-service is not available, consolidating the manual processes and
releasing the requestor from shepherding their requests is a step in the right
direction. Implementing this is a straightforward win with no technical
dependencies.

**Comment:** _This is more of a negative identifier than positive. Requestors
going through multiple requests to different disciplines, say network, servers and security is a sure sign of siloing. It’s paperwork walls and requirement ramparts between kingdoms. Requiring dependencies between those disciplines to be brokered through the requestor is fully broken._

## How many departments are involved in completing a typical request?

If the one-stop show is not possible, we want this number as low as possible. 

**Comment:** _Two could be arguably as good as one (security and everything
else) but going beyond that is broken._

## What is the turn-around time from request submission through delivery of all components?

This number should be as low as possible.

**Comment:** _A fully manual process with a turnaround time of hours or next
day is great target for becoming fully self-service as there’s a good chance
it’s already partially automated. Once you get above two days things are
broken as mid-week becomes next week and week long process blocks are the
equivalent of swapping to disk - orders of magnitude longer to context
switch._

## Which portions of this work are completed with by internal staff versus contractors?

Ideally, everything is done in-house.

**Comment:** _These functions are in the critical path of virtually every of
virtually everything else. You can’t afford to bound by an inflexible contract
here as it becomes the limiter of the entire operation._

## Are there any additional functions you would like to see made self-service?

Self-service everything.

**Comment:** _Looking for some agency specific process which might be a good
candidate for automation and self-servicizing. Gauging the relative priority
of the identified possibilities for self-service._
